Here's a glimpse of my values and passions so you can get a clearer idea of who I am (a very small one).

We are all guided by our values. The values that drive me are:

- Empathy towards others.
- I create digital products that enrich people's lives, not ones that make their lives more miserable.
- I build with truth. This aligns with who I am and who I aspire to be: integral, decent, and willing to improve.

I'm a [software developer](https://github.com/manuelalferez/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf), and I'm passionate about fostering communities of developers, (and also non-programmers). Previously I was the main organizer of [GDG Jaén](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/GDG-Jaen/), helping to grow the community of +1200 members and organizing events with more than 300 attendees. I am proud of the [flowinance](https://flowinance.com/) project.
You’ll find me enjoying nature most of the time. I am also exploring handwriting and seeking a deeper connection with what really matters to me.

Sorry, my Pomodoro just finished. See you
