Hey, I’m Manuel. Here’s a glimpse of my values and passions so you can form a clearer idea of who I am.

We are all guided by our values. The values that drive me are:

- Empathy towards others.
- I create digital products that enrich people's lives, not ones that make their lives more miserable.
- I build with truth. This aligns with who I am and who I aspire to be: integral, decent, and willing to improve.

I am a [software developer](https://github.com/manuelalferez/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf), and I am passionate about fostering developer communities, connecting people with similar interests.

You’ll find me enjoying nature most of the time. I am also exploring handwriting and seeking a deeper connection with what really matters to me.

It’s very interesting to see 'about' sections completely infused with professionalism. It feels as if, in your personal space on the internet, creativity is constrained by the demands of work. _I feel the obligation to showcase what I’ve done because it defines who I am_.

I’ll expand a bit more when I feel like it. Sorry, my [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) just finished.
