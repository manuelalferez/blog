As humans, we share a common consciousness: the ideas we produce, the music we play, the way we see the world and experience it, the books we write, and the infinite pieces created by humankind represent the human consciousness.

It is not finished. It cannot be defined by just one individual. It is the sum of the parts that contribute to the whole. We are not contributing for ourselves; we are doing it for the collective consciousness.
