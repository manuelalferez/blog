Passing your eyes through words and telling how many pages you read will not redeem you from ignorance. In fact, nothing substantial is changing within you.

Reading is useless unless you study the material: be intentional about what you read. There is no magic recipe. You study by taking notes, highlighting lines, and summarizing what the author says. Donâ€™t write in a notebook; keep pieces of knowledge as close to the main source as possible: the actual book.

If you're unable to discern the structure and purpose of a book, don't even bother yourself with reading it. You've already failed at the first step: understanding the author's intention and what problem they're attempting to solve.
